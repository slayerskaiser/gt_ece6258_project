GT ECE 6258 Project: Fish detection and tracking in underwater GoPro video
==================
by Klaus Okkelberg and Mengmeng Du
------------------

This project deals with processing underwater GoPro videos to detect, track, and recognize fish. The implementation is in Matlab.

The main steps for implementing this project are
  - Correction of spatial and color distortion
  - Detection of moving fish
  - Detection of non-moving fish and tracking
  - Recognition of fish

The following videos are being considered for this project:
  - GOPR0073
  - GOPR0062
  - GOPR0063
  - GOPR0059
